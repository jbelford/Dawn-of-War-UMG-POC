# Dawn of War: Ultimate Matchup Generator
*Working title*

This little project is to compliment Relic's Dawn of War by being a tool for generating and creating "playlists" or "campaigns"
to complete. The hope is that this can be a bit of redemption for that crappy old Java Spring app I made a while back https://www.moddb.com/games/dawn-of-war/downloads/campaign-generator-dow-ssua

It parses the user's game directory files to retrieve information. Right now it only fetches Map data as well as Game rules + Addons.

## Tools
* React.js
* Webpack
* Node.js + Electron
* Typescript
